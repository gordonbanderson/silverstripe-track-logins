# SilverStripe - Track Member Logins

A very simple module, shamelessly stolen from https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/extending/how_tos/track_member_logins/,
and adapted as a one shot fix for the customer report in the shop module.


## Installation

Using `git`, clone the repo to a location of your choice:

```bash
composer require suilven/silverstripe-track-member
```
